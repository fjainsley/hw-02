```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## **DO NOT EDIT THIS CODE CHUNK**
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#run install.packages("cherryblossom") on the console to get the run17 dataset

library(tidyverse)
library(cherryblossom)  
```



## Exercise 1

```{r ex1a, out.width="80%"}
run17 %>%
  filter(event == "10 Mile") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)
```


The histogram is bell shaped and skewed to the left suggesting that it is more popular in those young


```{r ex1b, out.width="80%"}
run17 %>%
  filter(event == "5K") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)





```


Similarly to the 10 mile event this is roughly a bell which is skewed to the left, however the smaller sample size has resulted in a much less smooth curve and this does not follow the trend continuously(the early spike betwen 5 - 13 yeaars)

## Exercise 2

```{r ex2, out.width = "80%"}
 Run17_Minutes <- 
  mutate(run17,
         Minutes = net_sec/60, 
         Sex = sex)
ggplot(data = na.omit(Run17_Minutes), 
mapping = aes(y = Minutes, x = Sex)) + 
geom_boxplot( fill = "blue2",
colour = "green",
lwd = 0.8,          
outlier.shape = 3,  
outlier.colour = "orange") +facet_grid(~event)







```

## Exercise 3

```{r ex3, out.width = "80%"}
Run17_Miles <- filter(run17, event == "10 Mile") 


 Run17_Waves <- 
   na.omit(
     mutate(
       Run17_Miles,
       Wave = case_when(clock_sec-net_sec <180 ~ "First Wave",
  clock_sec-net_sec > 1380 ~ "Last Wave")))
 
 
 ggplot(data = na.omit(Run17_Waves), 
mapping = aes(
x = age,
y = net_sec/60,
colour = Wave)) +
geom_point() +   geom_smooth(method = lm) +
labs(
x = "Runner's Age, in years",
y = "Race Time (Minutes)",
colour = "Wave",
title = "Scatter Plot of 10 Mile Race, Time Against Age",
subtitle = "
First vs Last Wave")

#### Example of a good data visualisation

```{r ex4_good_viz, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# edit the file path accordingly
